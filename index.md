### Classifying Sleep Disorders
Sleep disorders in the UK are highly prevalent; Apnea and Insomnia being two common examples with large health consequences. Typically, the two disorders have different underlying causes: this separation in the causal factors lends strength to the hypothesis that a machine learning model could predict, with high success, whether someone suffers from one of these conditions. In this project, I took a deep dive approach to develop a performant model for classifying patients using the multi positive-class F1 score as the target metric.

### Automating Data Discovery in SQL
Receiving and processing data for a new project can be very time consuming, especially if repeated for many clients. SQL scripting using and dynamic T-SQL is an excellent choice for automating this work where possible. In this work, I build a script-based approach, the same approach that was key to saving many hours and procedurising the data discovery process of one of KPMG's flagship products.

### Building a Web Scraper for Bids 
The success of any consultancy rests on winning new work. Scoping for bids is a task that can be automated with the right tools. In this project, I built a web scraper to search the Digital Outcomes and Specialists webpage and automatically extract applicable bids with key information depending on key word search. While not in the notebook, this application was hosted on Azure and Logic Apps used to execute the script and send an email to the team's bid owners on a weekly basis.
