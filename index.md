### Automating Data Discovery in SQL
Receiving and processing data for a new project can be very time consuming, especially if repeated for many clients. SQL scripting using and dynamic T-SQL is an excellent choice for automating this work where possible. In this work, I build a script-based approach, the same approach that was key to saving many hours and procedurising the data discovery process of one of KPMG's flagship products.
